                    <p>We seek to innovate in a way that minimizes the gap between our offerings and client needs, until both are at zero distance from one another.

Infosys Nia is a knowledge-based AI platform. It brings machine learning together with the deep knowledge of an organization to drive automation and innovation.</p>
